Cache-Simulator
Cache Simulator in C written for Computer Architecture course CS 198:211 at Rutgers University

This is a simple cache simulator that calculates the number of memory writes and memory reads for a memory access pattern provided as a file. The inputs to the program, aside from the file listing the memory accesses, are parameters that specify the cache to be simulated.

Note: Although the help function suggests n-associative caches are supported, there is not yet any provision for modelling n-associative caches. Only direct association is currently supported. Moreover, the only replacement strategy currently implemented is the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy, although the intention is to support Least-Recently-Used (LRU) replacement as well in the future.

Usage: sim <cache size> <associativity> <block size> <replacement algorithm> <write policy> <tracefile.txt>

More information about arguments:

<cache size>: must be a power of 2 integer represented in decimal(base 10)

<associativity>:

-direct  - simulates of a direct-mapped cache
<pre>-assoc:n - simulates an n-way associative cache where n is an integer that is a power of 2</pre>
<block size>: must be a power of 2 integer represented in decimal(base 10)

<replacement algorithm>:

-FIFO - simulates first-in-first-out replacement
-LRU - simulates least-recently-used replacement
<write policy>: -wt - simulates a write-through cache

<tracefile>: Must be a text file with the memory access trace of a program. Each line in the file must be formatted as follows: 'instruction pointer value'':'<space>'W or R signifying read or write'<space>'memory address accessed'
